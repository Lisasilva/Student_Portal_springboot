# Student_Portal_springboot

This is an intricate Java-Spring Boot Student Management System. 
Utilized sophisticated tools such as Eclipse, Postman, and MySQL 
Workbench, to engage in multifaceted software design and intricate database management tasks. It 
conducts complex SQL execution via native queries combining it with meticulous interface 
implementation. This task demanded an astute application of advanced JPA/Hibernate techniques 
for Object Relational Mapping (ORM), necessitating the implementation of Data Transfer Object 
(DTO) methodologies and CRUD operations.
The functionality of the Student Management System is expansive. It encompasses features like 
assimilating data from Excel spreadsheets, organizing this data into structured tables, executing data 
extraction based on specific student ID parameters, and computing statistical analyses such as 
percentage calculations, segmented by criteria like semesters and departments.
Utilized REST APIs and proficiently handled them using Postman and leveraged the capabilities of Java's Stream API.
